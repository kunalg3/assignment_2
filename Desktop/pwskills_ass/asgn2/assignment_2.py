 Comments in Python are identified with a hash symbol, #, and extend to the end of the line. Hash characters in a  string are not considered comments, however. There are three ways to write a comment - as a separate line, beside the  corresponding statement of code, or as a multi-line comment block.
 There are three types of comments: single-line, multi-line, and docstring comments. The syntax of comments varies  depending on the type. This tutorial will explore every kind of comment individually, along with examples.
 
 Single-Line Comments
 Single-line comments begin with the “#” character. Anything that is written in a single line after ‘#’ is considered  as a comment. The syntax for writing single-line comments is:
 
 # comments here
 Multi-Line Comments
 Python does not support multi-line comments. However, there are multiple ways to overcome this issue. None of these  ways are technically multi-line comments, but you can use them as one. The first way is by using # at the beginning of  each line of the comment.
 You can also use multi-line strings for commenting. To do this, use either a ‘’ or “” quotation marks three times.
 Python Docstrings
 Python provides an in-built feature called docstrings for commenting on modules, methods, functions, objects, and  classes. They are written in the first line after defining a module, function, method, etc., using three quotation  marks (‘’ or “”). If you do not use it in the first line, the interpreter will not take it as a docstring. You can  also access docstrings using the __doc__ attribute.

 Variables are free storage that they can store int,string,bool,double,etc values
 In Python, variables need not be declared or defined in advance, as is the case in many other programming languages. To create a variable, you just assign it a value and then start using it. Assignment is done with a single equals sign (=)
 n = 300#example

#Ans 3
 in python one variable can be converted to another data type as 
 a="10"
 b=int(a)

 The most basic and easy way to run a Python script is by using the python command. You need to open a command line and type the word python followed by the path to your script file like this:
 python first_script.py
 Hello World!
 
#ans 5
 lst=[1,2,3,4,5]
 print(lst[1:3])

 Complex Numbers in Maths. Complex numbers are the numbers that are expressed in the form of a+ib where, a is real part and b is an imaginary part. and i is iota 
 # Initializing complex number
 z = 5+3j
 # Print the parts of Complex No.
 print("The real part of complex number is : ", end="")
 print(z.real)
 
 print("The imaginary part of complex number is : ", end="")
 print(z.imag)
